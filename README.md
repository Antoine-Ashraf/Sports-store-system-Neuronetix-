#Point of Sale (POS) System
Developed a custom Java-based Point of Sale (POS) solution, leveraging object-oriented programming principles to implement features such as customer management, item purchases, stock management, and automated invoice generation. The application utilized abstraction through interfaces to handle item discounts, incorporating polymorphic behavior to accommodate various product types. It allowed customers to dynamically purchase multiple store-related items, with an automated invoice system providing a detailed breakdown of purchased items, applied discounts, and total costs. This project highlights expertise in designing modular, maintainable Java applications that deliver practical and dynamic retail solutions.
